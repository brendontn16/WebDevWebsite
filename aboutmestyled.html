    <p id="para2">Bit of backstory of this picture, I was a part of the University's esports team and during picture day I was told to do a fun pose. They then used this picture for social media for Valentine's day last year</p>
    <p id="para3">I enjoy playing video games and I have an expensive hobby I am too broke for of collecting computer tech, whether it be audio equipment, custom keyboards, mice, and even artisan mousepads.</p>
