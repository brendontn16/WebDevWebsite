<h2>I hate this picture but this is me, Brendon Nguyen</h2>
<div>
<p>I am a senior in computer science and I enjoy playing video games.</p>
<p>Bit of backstory of this picture, I was a part of the University's esports team and during picture day I was told to do a fun pose. They then used this picture for social media for Valentine's day last year</p>
