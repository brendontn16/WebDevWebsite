    <p>I am a senior in computer science and I enjoy playing video games.</p>
    <p >Bit of backstory of this picture, I was a part of the University's esports team and during picture day I was told to do a fun pose. They then used this picture for social media for Valentine's day last year</p>
    <p>I enjoy playing video games and I have an expensive hobby I am too broke for of collecting computer tech, whether it be audio equipment, custom keyboards, mice, and even artisan mousepads.</p>
